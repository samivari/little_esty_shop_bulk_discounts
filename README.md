# Little Esty Shop

"Little Esty Shop" is a group project that requires students to build a fictitious e-commerce platform where merchants and admins can manage inventory and fulfill customer invoices.
As a final project, "Bulk Discounts" is an exstention of the project, where merchents have bulk discounts to apply to their invoices.


## Learning Goals

-Write migrations to create tables and relationships between tables
-Implement CRUD functionality for a resource using forms (form_tag or form_with), buttons, and links
-Use MVC to organize code effectively, limiting the amount of logic included in views and controllers
-Use built-in ActiveRecord methods to join multiple tables of data, make calculations, and group data based on one or more attributes
-Write model tests that fully cover the data logic of the application
-Write feature tests that fully cover the functionality of the application
